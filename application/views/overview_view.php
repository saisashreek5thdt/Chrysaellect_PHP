								  <b>Four cross disciplinary themes:</b> The most unique and critical feature of The Mind Spark curriculum is the four cross disciplinary over arching themes. These over arching themes are about areas of discussion that have meaning for, and are relevant to children. The curriculum framework allows children to move beyond the confines of learning within predetermined subject areas and allows for a more holistic understanding of concepts. Following are the cross disciplinary themes:
							   <ul class="list-square" style="text-align:left">
								  <li>
									 Who I am
								  </li>
								  <li> My World</li>
								  <li>Living and non living</li>
								  <li>
									 Beyond my world
								  </li>
							   </ul>
