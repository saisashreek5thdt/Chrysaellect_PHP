							   We at Chrysaellect believe that nothing can be taught.  The teacher is not an instructor but rather a facilitator and a guide to nurture active minds to make meaning of their world.  Meaningful learning happens when experiences are contextualized to the social environment.  In our view children are capable, competent, and able to build their knowledge through active explorations, experience, discussions, and inquiry. They need to be provided with opportunities to develop questions, and to hypothesize about possible connections to extend their learning.

							   Research, theory and experience in the field of early childhood education inform our curriculum development team to create our preschool curriculum frameworks. Recent brain research has improved our understanding of how and when children learn best. The human brain is affected by experiences and therefore children’s learning changes the physical structure of their brain. Every appropriate sensory motor experience that is provided to the child helps build brain connections.
							</p>
							<p style="text-align:justify">Using this insight our curriculum provides a variety of activities to practice new skills. The Curriculum facilitates in creating rich experiences and positive interactions which affect learning, attention, memory and behavior in children.</p>

							   A play-based, hands-on, active learning environment is most conducive for young learners. We believe that this approach, which includes the whole child, prepares children well for future success, both in school and in their lives. The curriculum and learning environments are intertwined to offer opportunities for exploratory play where children can manipulate materials, hypothesize, test theories, repeat activities and draw conclusions. In their social play, children learn how to be a member of a larger community.
